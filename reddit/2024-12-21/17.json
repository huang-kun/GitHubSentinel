        "image_description": "The image is a popular meme format featuring Kermit the Frog. In this particular meme, Kermit is depicted holding a cup of tea, which symbolizes him minding his own business while observing a situation. The text on the meme points out that the government can seize the assets of people who broke immigration laws, and claims that Elon Musk has broken such laws, concluding with “but that’s none of my business.” This combination of imagery and text is often used to comment on controversial topics while maintaining a humorous tone."
